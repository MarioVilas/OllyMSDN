===============================================================================

This plugin will replace WIN32.HLP with online help from the MSDN website.

To install:
    1) Copy OllyMSDN.dll to OllyDbg's or ImmDbg's plugin directory.
    2) Start the debugger.
    3) If you haven't done so already, go to Help -> Select API help file
       and select WIN32.HLP as usual. It doesn't need to be the real file,
       just one named like that.

To use:
    *) When you click on Help -> Open API help file, the MSDN online website
       will be opened instead.
    *) To get help on individual API calls, right-click on the CALL instruction
       in the CPU pane and click on "Help on symbolic name".
